						<h2>When Things Felt Heavy</h2>
					</header>
					<p>There were days when everything felt heavier than usual. Words became harder to say, jokes didn’t
						land the same, and silence slowly filled the spaces between us. It wasn’t about anger, but about
						emotions we didn’t fully understand yet. Those days were uncomfortable, confusing, and tiring,
						but they were also part of learning how to stay, even when it wasn’t easy.</p>

								<h3>When Words Fell Short</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Sometimes we talked a lot, but somehow didn’t really hear each other. What was meant to
								be simple turned complicated, and small misunderstandings slowly grew bigger. It wasn’t
								about who was right or wrong, just two people trying to explain their feelings in
								different languages. That’s when silence started to feel louder than words.</p>

								<h3>The Long Quiet Walk</h3>
							</header>
							<p>We kept walking uphill, step by step, but without words in between. The path felt longer
								than it should, not because of the height, but because of the silence. I tried to joke,
								to talk, to break it, but everything stayed quiet. That day, the mountain wasn’t the
								hardest thing to climb.</p>

								<h3>A Brave Smile</h3>
							</header>
							<p>That day was clearly heavy for you, I could see it in the way you stayed quiet. But you
								still smiled at me, like you didn’t want me to worry. It wasn’t a big smile, just enough
								to say “I’m okay” even when you weren’t. And somehow, that smile stayed with me.</p>
