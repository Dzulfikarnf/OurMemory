						<h2>After the Storm</h2>

					<p>We went through quiet days, heavy talks, and moments that almost pulled us apart. Not everything
						was solved perfectly, but we learned how to stay. How to listen, how to wait, and how to hold on
						without forcing. This part isn’t about winning or losing, it’s about surviving together, and
						choosing to keep going slowly, honestly, as us.</p>

								<h3>Learning to Stay</h3>
							</header>
							<p>After everything we went through, we learned how to stay without hurting. We talked more
								carefully, listened more honestly, and gave each other space when it was needed. It
								wasn’t about fixing everything at once, but about growing together, slowly, quietly, and
								with intention.</p>

								<h3>Quietly Together</h3>
							</header>
							<p>There was no big moment here, no celebration or loud happiness. Just us, being together
								in silence that finally felt safe. We didn’t need to explain much anymore. Being side by
								side was enough, and for the first time in a while, the quiet didn’t hurt.</p>

								<h3>Still Choosing You</h3>

							<p>After all the noise, the silence, and the growing pains, we’re still here. Not because
								everything is perfect, but because we keep choosing each other. Again and again, in
								small ways that matter. This is us, and this is where we stay.</p>
