								<h3>When It Was Still Messy</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Those were our early days, when emotions ran high and everything felt a little messy. We
								didn’t always know how to communicate, how to react, or how to understand each other
								properly. Mistakes happened, feelings clashed, and nothing felt steady yet. But even in
								that fragile beginning, we were already trying, learning as we went, and slowly figuring
								out what it meant to choose each other.</p>

								<h3>Learning to Walk Together</h3>
							</header>
							<p>This was the phase when we started moving forward, even though nothing felt fully right
								yet. We were still carrying doubts, misunderstandings, and unfinished emotions from the
								beginning. Some days felt heavy, some steps felt unsure, but we kept walking anyway.
								Slowly, we learned that being together wasn’t about having everything figured out, it
								was about choosing to stay and grow, even when things were still fragile.</p>

								<h3>Getting Used to Us</h3>
							</header>
							<p>This was when things started to feel more familiar, even though we were still at the
								beginning. We began to understand each other’s habits, moods, and little patterns. It
								wasn’t perfect, and we still stumbled sometimes, but being together no longer felt
								strange. Slowly, us became something we were getting used to, gentle, growing, and
								quietly meaningful.</p>
