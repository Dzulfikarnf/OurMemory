						<h2>The Moment It Felt Right</h2>
					</header>
					<p>That day didn’t come with big plans or grand moments. We just spent time together, without
						rushing or overthinking anything. Everything felt lighter, calmer, and easier than before. It
						wasn’t about doing something special, it was about how natural it felt to be there, together,
						and finally at ease.</p>

								<h3>Timezone Day</h3>
							</header>
							<p>That day, we spent our time at Timezone, playing games without really caring about who
								won. We laughed over small victories, failed miserably at some games, and tried again
								anyway. It felt light, silly, and fun, like we were just two people enjoying the
								moment, forgetting about everything else for a while.</p>

								<h3>Hayabusa & Kagura</h3>
							</header>
							<p>That day, we brought home two tiny lives and gave them names that somehow felt just
								right, Hayabusa and Kagura. Watching them move around, eat, and explore their little
								world made us smile for no big reason. It was a small moment, but it felt warm, like we
								were building something together, even in the simplest way.</p>

								<h3>Photobooth in Braga</h3>
							</header>
							<p>We stepped into a small photobooth in Braga, not expecting much, just laughs and random
								poses. The camera flashed, time paused for a moment, and somehow those simple frames
								captured something real, our smiles, our closeness, and a happiness that didn’t need to
								be explained. It’s the kind of memory you keep without realizing how precious it’ll
								become.</p>
